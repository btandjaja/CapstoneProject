# Garage Sale (Capstone)
In this project, I decided to create an app that rather than hosting garage sale on weekends where shoppers have to drive to the hoster location to view items that the host is selling, to be visible on the app. The seller can take pictures of the item to sell and it does not have to be on the weekend. When an item is sold, the seller will be notified through the widget app indicating that an item is sold or the seller can check back into the app and check whether they have sold any item. 

The reason for this app being born was because I wanted to create an app that is simple and requires very low fees to virtually none for everyone.
